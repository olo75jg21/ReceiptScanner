# Receipt Scanner - Flutter App & Express.js Backend

## Overview

Receipt Scanner is a mobile application developed as a team project at university. The app aims to simplify the process of scanning and managing receipts by providing users with the ability to capture, review, and categorize their receipts.

The project followed the Scrum methodology, enabling efficient collaboration and iterative development. As a team member, I was responsible for implementing the login, registration, displaying receipts list, and checking for details of a given element.

## Features

- User Login: Existing users can log in to access their accounts and app features securely.

- Receipt Scanning: Users can capture receipts using their device's camera and store the scanned data.

- Receipt List: All scanned receipts are displayed in a list view, showing important details like date, merchant, and total amount.

- Receipt Details: Users can tap on a receipt from the list to view more details about a specific receipt.
